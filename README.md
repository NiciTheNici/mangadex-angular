# mangadex-angular

This project is intended to be a first attempt to interact with RESTful services. Mangadex was chosen because they have been a huge source of entertainement for me, 
I'm planning on making something a bit more ambitious like a linux client for it built with qt, not because anyone asked for this, but because I feel like making something to show off for once ;)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
